The recent emergence of small low-cost commodity multi-core processors raises the possibility of running both kinds of applications on a single machine, with virtualization ensuring that the best-effort applications cannot steal CPU cycles from the real-time applications. Nevertheless, memory contention can introduce other sources of delay, that can lead to missed deadlines. In this paper, we analyze the sources of memory consumption for the real-time applications found in the MiBench embedded benchmark suite.},

	abstract = {Main memory is a major shared resource among cores in a multicore system. If the interference between different applications' memory requests is not controlled effectively, system performance can degrade significantly. Previous work aimed to mitigate the problem of interference between applications by changing the scheduling policy in the memory controller, i.e., by prioritizing memory requests from applications in a way that benefits system performance. In this paper, we first present an alternative approach to reducing inter-application interference in the memory system: application-aware memory channel partitioning (MCP). The idea is to map the data of applications that are likely to severely interfere with each other to different memory channels. The key principles are to partition onto separate channels 1) the data of light (memory non-intensive) and heavy (memory-intensive) applications, 2) the data of applications with low and high row-buffer locality. Second, we observe that interference can be further reduced with a combination of memory channel partitioning and scheduling, which we call integrated memory partitioning and scheduling (IMPS). The key idea is to 1) always prioritize very light applications in the memory scheduler since such applications cause negligible interference to others, 2) use MCP to reduce interference among the remaining applications. We evaluate MCP and IMPS on a variety of multi-programmed workloads and system configurations and compare them to four previously proposed state-of-the-art memory scheduling policies. Averaged over 240 workloads on a 24-core system with 4 memory channels, MCP improves system throughput by 7.1\% over an application-unaware memory scheduler and 1\% over the previous best scheduler, while avoiding modifications to existing memory schedulers. IMPS improves system throughput by 11.1\% over an application-unaware scheduler and 5\% over the previous best scheduler, while incurring much lower hardware complexity than the latter.},

	doi = {10.1109/RTAS.2015.7108391},
	abstract = {The translation look aside buffer (TLB) improves the performance of systems by caching the virtual page to physical frame mapping. But TLBs present a source of unpredictability for real-time systems. Standard heap allocated regions do not provide guarantees on the TLB set that will hold a particular page translation. This unpredictability can lead to TLB misses with a penalty of up to thousands of cycles and consequently intra- and inter-task interference resulting in loose bounds on the worst case execution time (WCET) and TLB-related preemption delay. In this work, we design and implement a new heap allocator that guarantees the TLB set, which will hold a particular page translation on a uniprocessor of a contemporary architecture. The allocator is based on the concept of page coloring, a software TLB partitioning method. Virtual pages are colored such that two pages of different color cannot map to the same TLB set. Our experimental evaluations confirm the unpredictability associated with the standard heap allocation. Using a set of synthetic and standard benchmarks, we show that our allocator provides task isolation for real-time tasks. To the best of our knowledge, such TLB isolation without special hardware support is unprecedented, increases TLB predictability and can facilitate WCET analysis.},
